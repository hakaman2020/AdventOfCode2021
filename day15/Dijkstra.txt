How dijkstra algorithm works

keep of list of visited nodes
keep a list of unvisited nodes but evaluated for minimum distance (thus not have infinity as minimum distance)
set minimum distance of start node to zero and start there

do until no more unvisited nodes:
	select the unvisited node with the lowest minimum distance from list of unvisited nodes 
	evaluate the connected unvisited neighbours and update their minimum distance and the previous node value if needed
	add each evaluated connected neighbour to list of unvisited unless already in there
	add selected node to visited node and remove from unvisited
